# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Logistic-Regression

Welcome to the "Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression" project. This repository contains a series of notebooks that walk goes through the process of performing sentiment analysis using logistic regression. Each  focuses on a specific aspect of the project.

1. [Preprocessing](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/1_preprocessing.ipynb target="_blank") - This notebook covers the preprocessing steps required to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis which include:
   * Tokenization 
   * Lowercasing
   * Removing stop words and punctuation
   * Stemming
     
2. [Word Frequencies](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/2_word%20frequencies.ipynb) - This notebook covers the function `build_freq` that build a word frequency dictionary, mapping each (word, sentiment) pair(tuple) to its frequency, which helps us when extracting the features of a list of tweets.

5. [Logistic Regression Model](3_logistic_regression_model.md) - Learn how to build and train a logistic regression model for sentiment analysis.

6. [Sentiment Analysis with LR](4_sentiment_analysis_with_lr.md) - The final  combines all the previous steps to perform sentiment analysis using the logistic regression model.

Feel free to explore each  to understand the details of each step in the sentiment analysis process.
