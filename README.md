# Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

Welcome to the NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces repository! 

This repository explores the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the lens of classification and vector space models.

Please explore the individual sub-repositories for projects:

## 1. [Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Logistic-Regression): 
- In the "Sentiment Analysis" repository, you'll dive into the world of sentiment analysis using logistic regression. We'll extract features from text, transform them into numerical vectors, and build a binary classifier for tweets. 

## 2. [Naive Bayes Tweet Classifier](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/NLP-with-classification-and-vector-spaces/tree/main/Sentiment%20analysis%20with%20classification/Naive%20Bayes)
- In the "Naive Bayes" section, we'll explore the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities and apply it to build a Naive Bayes tweet classifier.

## Word Vectors and Vector Space Models

The "Vector Space Models" section introduces you to the world of word vectors and vector space models. This part includes:

- 10 instructional videos
- 10 readings
- 1 quiz

Learn how to create word vectors that capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. Visualize these relationships in two dimensions using PCA.

## Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation and Document Search

In the final section, "Locality Sensitive Hashing," you'll delve into transforming word vectors and using locality sensitive hashing. This technique enables you to perform tasks like machine translation and document search. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and explore each section in the order that suits your learning needs. Each section includes instructional resources and code examples to help you grasp the concepts.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance. Happy learning!
