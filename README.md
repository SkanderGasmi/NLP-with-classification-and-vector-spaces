# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

Welcome to the "Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression" project. This repository contains a series of labs that walk you through the process of performing sentiment analysis using logistic regression. Each lab focuses on a specific aspect of the project.

## Labs

1. [Lab 1: Preprocessing](lab1_preprocessing.md) - This lab covers the preprocessing steps required to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis.

2. [Lab 2: Word Frequencies](lab2_word_frequencies.md) - In this lab, you'll explore word frequencies and their importance in sentiment analysis.

3. [Lab 3: Logistic Regression Model](lab3_logistic_regression_model.md) - Learn how to build and train a logistic regression model for sentiment analysis.

4. [Lab 4: Sentiment Analysis with LR](lab4_sentiment_analysis_with_lr.md) - The final lab combines all the previous steps to perform sentiment analysis using the logistic regression model.

Feel free to explore each lab to understand the details of each step in the sentiment analysis process.
