# Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

Welcome to the NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces repository! 

This repository explores the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the lens of classification and vector space models.

Please explore the individual sub-repositories for projects:

## 1. [Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/NLP-with-classification-and-vector-spaces/tree/main/Sentiment%20analysis%20with%20classification/Logistic%20regression)
- In the "Sentiment Analysis" repository, you'll dive into the world of sentiment analysis using logistic regression. We'll extract features from text, transform them into numerical vectors, and build a binary classifier for tweets. 

## 2. [Naive Bayes Tweet Classifier](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/NLP-with-classification-and-vector-spaces/tree/main/Sentiment%20analysis%20with%20classification/Naive%20Bayes)
- In the "Naive Bayes" section, we'll explore the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities and apply it to build a Naive Bayes tweet classifier.

## 3. [Word Vectors and Vector Space Models](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/NLP-with-classification-and-vector-spaces/tree/main/Vector%20space%20models)

The "Vector Space Models" section introduces you to the world of word vectors and vector space models that capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. and the visualization of these relationships in two dimensions using PCA.
